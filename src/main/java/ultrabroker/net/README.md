# ultraBrokerNet.jar
We would like to create ultraBrakerNet.jar file that stores all Java classes under ultrabroker.net directory.

There is a pair of Client and Server appliation that use this library in ultrabroker.net.sample directory. You should execute both programs so that they communicate each other.

As a communication rule, the Server always sends a message first; however, you can execute the Client applcation first without any issue because the Client application waits for the Server application until it is executed.

Go back to the main README.md: https://github.com/shigeru-takehara/UltraBroker/edit/main/README.md
