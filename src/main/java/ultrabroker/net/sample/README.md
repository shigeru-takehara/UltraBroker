# How to run ServerApp and ClientApp

The easiest way is to run on Eclipse Java project. You can run either ServerApp or ClientApp first. Once both applications are executed, both exchange message and finish.

**ServerApp displayes these lines:**

`Server received: This is client response. count = 0`

`This is the second line.`

`This is the third line.`

`Server received: This is client response. count = 1`

`This is the second line.`

`This is the third line.`

**ClientApp:**

`Client received: First Server Request`

`SecondLine`  

`Third line`

`Client received: Second Server Request`
